### Dive into Deeplearning
----------------------
- This is my 3rd time studying machine larning from the basics.
	- First time through the on-campus course in University of Florida taught by Assoc. Prof. Alina Zare.
	- Second time through the deep learning course from coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.
	- Everytime I study ML, I found something new, and I hopes this time, I can learn something more concrete, and can actually apply Ml to my dailylife.
